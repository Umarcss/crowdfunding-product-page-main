## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass/SCSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge required a few tricky things in JS. Also a few interesting layout changes. This was amazing practice all around.

### Continued development

As projects get larger and more difficult, more than ever, I want to start planning the project out better. I find this helps immensely.
